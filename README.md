# ADMIN-DASHBOARD
This was the fianl part of the intermediate html and css path in https://www.theodinproject.com/paths.
It was for the purpose of implementing grid method to work or build layouts, not also stopping the fact that flexbox could be used alongside grid method.
Took me days to get the layout to look like the provided one from odin and i made sure toavoid flex as much as possible only where necessary.

# JAVASCRIPT
Just an extra i decided to do;  adding dark theme, then also a side-bar that opens and closes.
